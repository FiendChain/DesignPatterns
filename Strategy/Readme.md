# Strategy Pattern
Allows for selecting different algorithms at runtime.
In purely OOP languages such as Java or C#, there are no pure functions, only
static functions or methods. 
The strategy pattern involves inheriting from an interface, and using it within
the program. The algorithm will be determined at run-time.
